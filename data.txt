Results in maps and charts Five key things we learned Live reaction At a feisty news conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump offered an olive branch to Democrats, proposing both parties work together on joint legislative priorities. But he said that if Democratic-controlled congressional committees started serving legal writs against his administration, Republicans would do likewise and gridlock would ensue.

"I'm not sure that I should be happy or sad but I feel just fine about it."

It's about restoring the Constitution's checks and balances to the Trump administration."Meanwhile the Florida Senate race is heading for a recount after Republican Rick Scott got 50.21% and incumbent Bill Nelson 49.79% of the vote. A margin of less than half a percentage point automatically triggers a recount.What difference will the new Congress make?The Democrats gained more than the 23 seats they needed for a majority in the 435-seat lower chamber.They could now launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs, from tax returns to potential conflicts of interest.The Democrats could also more effectively block his legislative plans, notably his signature promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico.In the Senate, Democrats were facing an uphill battle because they were defending 26 races, while just nine Republican seats were up for grabs.The Republicans are on course to increase their representation from 51 to 54 in the 100-seat Senate upper chamber.Mr Trump has threatened to retaliate for any Democratic investigations with his own probes in the Senate into alleged "leaks of classified information". Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level.

Silver liningsBy Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, WashingtonEven handing over power to Democrats in the House may have a bit of a silver lining for the president.Now he will have someone to blame if the economy takes a turn for the worse (and, given business cycle realities, it might). He's got a ready-made explanation for why he can't get anything done in the next two years - and a pitch for what needs to change in the next election.Day in and day out, he'll have a set of clear political opponents to contrast himself with.

Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama lost control of the House in their first term in office and went on to win re-election. History, serving as a guide, predicted this would probably be a bad night for the president.History also indicates that while the road may be rocky, better days could be ahead.What this all means for Trump More on the mid-terms: Young votes stamp their mark on politics What else did Americans vote for?
